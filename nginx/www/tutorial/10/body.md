Soufflé has two primitive types, namely the symbol type `symbol` and the number type `number`.

The symbol type comprises the universe of all strings. Internally, it is represented by an ordinal number. The value `ord("hello")` corresponds to this ordinal number for a given program, in this case for the string “hello”.

The number type comprises the universe of all numbers.
