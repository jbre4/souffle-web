A relation must be declared in order to be able to be used. We briefly note that the order in which lines of code are written in Soufflé code does not impact on a program’s correctness. The statement:

```
.decl edge(a:symbol, b:symbol)
```

Declares the relation `edge` with two fields, `a` and `b`, each of which are symbols (strings).
