Aggregation in Soufflé refers to the use of particular functors to summarise information about queries. Aggregates can only be applied on stable relations in Soufflé. Types of aggregates include counting, finding the minimum/maximum of a set of numbers, and summation. Generally in Soufflé, information cannot flow from the sub-goal (the argument/s of the aggregate functor) to the outer scope. For example, if one wishes to find the minimum value of the relation `Cost(x)`, they cannot find a specific value of `x` that minimises `Cost`. Indeed, such a value of `x` may not be unique.
