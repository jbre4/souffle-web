Soufflé’s type system is static, like languages like C and unlike languages like Python. The attributes of a relation must be defined before compilation (or interpretation), and types are checked at compile-time. This supports programmers having a clear idea of the definition of relations and their usage. To minimise evaluation time, no dynamic checks are made at runtime.

Types correspond to the subdivision of elements (relations) and sets of elements over the universe. In particular, a type refers to either a subset of a universe or the universe itself. Elements of subsets are not defined explicitly. As we shall see with union types, subsets can be composed of other subsets.
